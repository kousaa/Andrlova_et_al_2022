## MAIT and Vδ2 unconventional T cells predict favorable outcome after allogeneic HCT and are supported by a diverse intestinal microbiome

### Abstract 
Microbial diversity is associated with improved outcome in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), however, the mechanism underlying this observation is unclear. In a cohort of 174 allo-HCT patients, we demonstrate that a diverse intestinal microbiome early after HCT is associated with an increased number of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, which are in turn associated with improved overall survival and less acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Immune profiling of conventional and unconventional subsets revealed that the prevalence of V2 cells, the major circulating subpopulation of  T cells, closely correlated with MAITs and was also associated with less aGVHD. Moreover, a diverse intestinal microbiome, and the predicted fecal abundance of the microbial isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway that produces the phosphoantigen ligand for the V2 T cells, 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP), correlated with V2 cell numbers in blood. These data suggest a novel immunological link between intestinal microbial diversity, microbe-derived ligands and maintenance of unconventional T cells.
